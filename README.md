# ThesisB
This is an attempt to succesfully classify a political statement into one of six categories of fake news, ranging from most true, to most fake.

If you would like to view my code and output easily, please simply open the ThesisB_Final.ipynb file above and you will be able to see, section by section, the 
code and outputs.

To run my code yourself, please clone this repository and download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual "Anaconda") for your device. You can then open the Jupyter notebooks in the Anaconda application and open this code inside that notebook. From there you will be able to run my thesis and get all of the outputs for youself.
